            People of the Gold is a project that reflects on the identity, and history of the early Chinese immigrants that went to the USA in the period of gold rush. The project consists of multiple archive-looking looping videos that were generated by a machine learning algorithm. The constantly changing portrait photo of people and the "identity information" next to the photos are presented. Viewers are invited to browse those files generated by a software that was trained with documents and portraits of real people in the past. The artist intends to raise emotions and interests to history and the people of gold through exploring the potential of software in the field of photographic imaging and anthropology studies.
